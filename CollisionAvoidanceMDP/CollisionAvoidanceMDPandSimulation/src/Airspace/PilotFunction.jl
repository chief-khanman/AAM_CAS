# Here is the interface for a custom pilot function
# your function must take 1 argument: The state array
# Additionally, provides a RNG. You must use this to generate randomness (if you choose to), or your results will not be reproducible. 

# your function must return 1 action array
# To see what the state and action array consists of, see the MDP

# The below function is a default pilot behavior. It goes straight to the destination, ignoring intruders.
# Slight noise is added to make the aircraft swerve
